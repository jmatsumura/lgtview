=head1 NAME

merge_fasta_or_bam.pl - More recent iterations of the LGTSeek pipeline produce split files. 
Merge these in order to accommodate the scripts currently in place to extract metadata.  

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Extracts metadata from the output of LGTseek and enables this to be loaded into LGTview.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is a precursor for two scripts. First, merging BLAST result files provides the input for
isolate_best_blast_hits.pl which this output can then be used for extract_metadata.pl. Second, 
merging BAM files provides the other input for extract_metadata.pl.

*** PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING ***
-The BLAST files should be in m8 format.
-This script requires samtools installed in order to merge the bam files. 

=head1 USAGE

With either (blast|bam) list file this takes 3 options. Note that the blast/bam options
ought to be consistent with one another throughout:
./merge_blast_or_bam.pl my_(blast|bam).list (blast|bam) my_out_file.(blast|bam)
